[Question]:
I am going to write an extension file with C#.
Just tell me, what categories do you divide the methods that are written in the FileExtensions class?

Hello, this is Bing. I can help you with categorizing the methods of the FileExtensions class. blush

A FileExtensions class is a way to add new functionality to the existing File type in C# without modifying or inheriting from it. You can use extension methods to create custom methods that operate on File instances, such as reading, writing, copying, or deleting files.

You can categorize the methods of the FileExtensions class based on different criteria, such as the type of operation, output, input, or logic of each method. For example, you can group the methods into categories such as reading, writing, copying, or deleting methods.

One possible way to categorize the methods of the FileExtensions class is:

•  Reading methods: These are methods that read data from a file, such as text, bytes, or objects. For example, ReadAllText, ReadAllBytes, ReadObject, etc.

•  Writing methods: These are methods that write data to a file, such as text, bytes, or objects. For example, WriteAllText, WriteAllBytes, WriteObject, etc.

•  Copying methods: These are methods that copy a file to another location, with or without overwriting the existing file. For example, Copy, CopyOverwrite, etc.

•  Deleting methods: These are methods that delete a file from a location, with or without checking if the file exists. For example, Delete, DeleteIfExists, etc.

•  Checking methods: These are methods that check if a file exists, is readable, is writable, or is empty. For example, Exists, IsReadable, IsWritable, IsEmpty, etc.

•  Getting methods: These are methods that get information about a file, such as the name, path, size, extension, or creation date. For example, GetName, GetPath, GetSize, GetExtension, GetCreationDate, etc.

•  Setting methods: These are methods that set information about a file, such as the name, path, extension, or attributes. For example, SetName, SetPath, SetExtension, SetAttributes, etc.

•  Moving methods: These are methods that move a file to another location, with or without overwriting the existing file. For example, Move, MoveOverwrite, etc.

•  Renaming methods: These are methods that rename a file, with or without overwriting the existing file. For example, Rename, RenameOverwrite, etc.

•  Appending methods: These are methods that append data to the end of a file, such as text, bytes, or objects. For example, AppendText, AppendBytes, AppendObject, etc.

•  Replacing methods: These are methods that replace data in a file, such as text, bytes, or objects. For example, ReplaceText, ReplaceBytes, ReplaceObject, etc.

•  Searching methods: These are methods that search for data in a file, such as text, bytes, or objects. For example, SearchText, SearchBytes, SearchObject, etc.

•  Filtering methods: These are methods that filter data in a file, such as text, bytes, or objects. For example, FilterText, FilterBytes, FilterObject, etc.

•  Sorting methods: These are methods that sort data in a file, such as text, bytes, or objects. For example, SortText, SortBytes, SortObject, etc.

•  Merging methods: These are methods that merge data from two or more files, such as text, bytes, or objects. For example, MergeText, MergeBytes, MergeObject, etc.

•  Splitting methods: These are methods that split data from a file into two or more files, such as text, bytes, or objects. For example, SplitText, SplitBytes, SplitObject, etc.

•  Encrypting methods: These are methods that encrypt data in a file, using a certain algorithm, key, or password. For example, Encrypt, EncryptWithKey, EncryptWithPassword, etc.

•  Decrypting methods: These are methods that decrypt data in a file, using a certain algorithm, key, or password. For example, Decrypt, DecryptWithKey, DecryptWithPassword, etc.

•  Compressing methods: These are methods that compress data in a file, using a certain algorithm or format. For example, Compress, CompressWithZip, CompressWithGzip, etc.

•  Decompressing methods: These are methods that decompress data in a file, using a certain algorithm or format. For example, Decompress, DecompressWithZip, DecompressWithGzip, etc.

•  Hashing methods: These are methods that generate a hash value for data in a file, using a certain algorithm or format. For example, Hash, HashWithMD5, HashWithSHA1, etc.

•  Verifying methods: These are methods that verify the integrity or authenticity of data in a file, using a hash value, a signature, or a certificate. For example, Verify, VerifyWithHash, VerifyWithSignature, VerifyWithCertificate, etc.

•  Signing methods: These are methods that sign data in a file, using a private key or a certificate. For example, Sign, SignWithPrivateKey, SignWithCertificate, etc.

•  Validating methods: These are methods that validate data in a file, using a schema, a format, or a rule. For example, Validate, ValidateWithSchema, ValidateWithFormat, ValidateWithRule, etc.

•  Parsing methods: These are methods that parse data in a file, using a parser, a format, or a rule. For example, Parse, ParseWithParser, ParseWithFormat, ParseWithRule, etc.

•  Serializing methods: These are methods that serialize data in a file, using a serializer, a format, or a rule. For example, Serialize, SerializeWithSerializer, SerializeWithFormat, SerializeWithRule, etc.

•  Deserializing methods: These are methods that deserialize data in a file, using a deserializer, a format, or a rule. For example, Deserialize, DeserializeWithDeserializer, DeserializeWithFormat, DeserializeWithRule, etc.

•  Converting methods: These are methods that convert data in a file, using a converter, a format, or a rule. For example, Convert, ConvertWithConverter, ConvertWithFormat, ConvertWithRule, etc.
